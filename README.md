# Quantum Computing Project – QCourse110-1 ⚛️

This repository contains my work for QCourse110-1, an intensive quantum computing program
jointly organized by QWorld, Alamein International University, QEgypt, and Alexandria Quantum Computing Group.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Quantum bits (Qubits) and quantum states
- Superposition and entanglement
- Quantum measurement
- Quantum gates and quantum circuits
- Quantum protocols: Teleportation & Superdense Coding
- Quantum algorithms: Deutsch–Jozsa and Grover’s Algorithm

## 🧪 Practical Work
- Hands-on programming labs based on QWorld learning tracks
- Implementation and simulation of quantum circuits
- Individual final project

## 🎯 Outcome
- Final Grade: **300 / 300**
- Strong theoretical and practical understanding of quantum computing fundamentals

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Quantum Computing Simulators
- Linear Algebra

## 😄 Fun Fact
Debugging quantum circuits feels like debugging the universe itself.
